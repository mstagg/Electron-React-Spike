# Electron + React + Redux + React-Router Boilerplate

An example of using Electron with popular React libraries to create a simple electron application. Can be used as boilerplate for a new project, or used as a reference. Builds currently only targets windows, but other OS can be added easily.

## Scripts
```npm start``` will start the Electron app and the React app at the same time.  
```npm run build``` will build the React app and package it along with the Electron app.
